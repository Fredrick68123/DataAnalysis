# DataAnalysis
I am a DataAnalyst and I am posting my scripts here as show of my capabilities

in Code1 I have imported a stackoverflow survey file and answeard 3 questions
to do that, I have done things like making filters for desired values in columns
removing NaN values, selecting requierd columns and data to get some conclusions.

in Code2 I have converted a column into datetime data, changed indexes,
changed column names and positions, sorted data, changed and replaced strings inside the columns and more
in order to prepare the file for analysis and visuallization.

it must be noted that analysis and visuallization wasen't done for the second code file. it was just a show of my abilities.

I will post more where I prepared data for analysis and visuallization using PowerBi.
